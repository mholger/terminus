--------------

Terminus is a BBS package (and a BBS running that package), built from the
ground up under Linux and with various, specific goals.  If you want to know
more, go check out the OVERVIEW file, but in general Terminus was built with
a few basic goals:
 * Flexibility
 * Originality
 * Usability

These goals are all aimed at making each Terminus system unique and
enjoyable, both to participate on and to operate.
