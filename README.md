Terminus is a BBS package (and a BBS running that package), built from the
ground up under Linux and with various, specific goals.  If you want to know
more, go check out the OVERVIEW file, but in general Terminus was built with
a few basic goals:
 * Flexibility
 * Originality
 * Usability

These goals are all aimed at making each Terminus system unique and
enjoyable, both to participate on and to operate.  The BBS scene, quite
frankly, is anemic and stagnating; to mitigate those factors, a BBS package
needs to be as pleasant to run and to use as possible, and to offer something
of value to its visitors.



1. Contact

For any questions, comments, or to help out with the project, please contact
mholger@optera.net.  The codebase is available for checkout via svn from
http://optera.svn.beanstalkapp.com/terminus.  You can email patches to me at
the aforementioned email address, and if you're a regular contributor of
quality code, I may even offer you write-access to the repository to check in
your changes directly.  If you're just interested in following along with the
off-and-on development that occurs, check out TerminusBBS on Twitter.  Tweets
will follow changes in the subversion repository, and once the BBS goes live
I'm hoping to integrate various BBS activity notifications as well.
